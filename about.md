I am a high school senior at Ahlcon International School, studying Computer Science.

I am currently working as an Artificial Intelligence intern at [Tech Mahindra](https://www.techmahindra.com/en-in/innovation/makers-lab/), where I am mostly working on Natural Language Processing.

Previously, I have worked as a data science intern under Mr. Savio Fernandes, from Walmart Labs India. I am also working on creating a machine learning based [natural language tool](https://sentiment-ai.herokuapp.com), which is entirely implemented in Python.

You can find some of my projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) and you can check out the others at my [Github](https://github.com/achintyajha) profile. Apart from programming, I have been interested in some other fields throughout highschool- primarily Taekwondo, music, and writing.

Feel free to reach out if you wish to collaborate on something.<br />
