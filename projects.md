**[SentimentAI](https://sentimate.ml/)** A Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning based model that is capable of using text for identifying depression.

**[Climate Crew](https://climate-crew.ml/)** The idea is to spread knowledge and awareness about Climate through storytelling. I have developed this website, where our team has posted self-authored unique stories that provide a historical as well as mythological perspective to Climate.
