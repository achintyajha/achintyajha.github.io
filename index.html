    <b>Hi, I'm Achintya!</b>
    <br/>
    I'm a high school senior at Ahlcon International School, studying Computer Science.
    Currently, I am an Artificial Intelligence intern at <a href="https://www.techmahindra.com/en-in/innovation/makers-lab/">Tech 
    Mahindra</a>, where I'm mostly working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
    <br />
    Previously, I have worked as a data science intern under Mr. Savio Fernandes, from Walmart Labs India. 
    I am also working on creating a machine learning based <a href="https://sentimate.herokuapp.com/">natural language tool</a>, 
    which is entirely implemented in Python.
    You can find some of my projects <a href="https://achintyajha.in/projects/">here</a> and the others at my 
    <a href="https://github.com/achintyajha">Github</a> profile. 
    <br />
    For collaboration or information of any sort, feel free to drop an email at achintya [at] achintyajha [dot] com<br />
    You can also find me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/achintyajha05">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/achintyajha">Github</a>
